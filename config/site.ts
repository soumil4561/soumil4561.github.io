  extendedDescription: `I’m Soumil Singh, a software engineer currently based in Bangalore, who enjoys building efficient, scalable systems and exploring how things work under the hood.\n
I am a computer science graduate from the Indian Institute of Information Technology, Vadodara, where I developed a strong foundation in algorithms, data structures, and software design.\n
I work primarily with Node.js, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, and Cloud — building services that balance reliability and performance. Lately, I’ve been exploring lower-level C/C++ to better understand system internals and performance optimization.\n
Outside of work, I enjoy building side projects that challenge my problem-solving skills — from creating an image-processor in go and  SDL-based graphics projects. I am also interested in system design and architecture\n
I am passionate about continuous learning, exploring new technologies, and sharing knowledge through writing and collaboration. I’m always excited to connect with like-minded engineers, contribute to open-source projects, and take on interesting challenges.`
